**Booking seeker**  
My personal project to make search of options easier and faster. I like to invent such different automations and involve them into my routine.

It's just a yet another Python project. You should set up the PostgreSQL database and run main.ru.

Like this ``python main.py``

Before the first running you have to start database mirgrations using -m parameter: ``python main.py -m``
